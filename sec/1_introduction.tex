\section{Introduction}
%The project is mainly for emotion recognition in videos.
Emotion recognition is an indispensable part of computer vision. As facial expression is one of the most direct and way in which humans express themselves, emotion recognition makes it possible for computers to understand human beings directly, which is essential for making human-friendly computers or robots.\\

In this project, we will try several different models for emotion recognition, and we will try to optimize some models for fast inference. As application in robotics need very low energy consumption, we cannot use very powerful GPUs on robots, so we need a high efficiency algorithms for fast and efficient emotion recognition.
