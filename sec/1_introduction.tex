\section{Introduction}
Emotion recognition represents a critical frontier in computer vision, enabling machines to interpret human facial expressionsâ€”one of our most fundamental forms of non-verbal communication. This capability is essential for developing truly intuitive human-computer interfaces and responsive robotic systems.\\

This project addresses the challenge of real-time emotion recognition on resource-constrained platforms. While powerful deep learning models can achieve impressive accuracy, they often require substantial computational resources incompatible with edge devices. We focus on developing efficient algorithms that maintain high accuracy while operating in real-time on standard laptops with integrated GPUs or even smartphones.\\

Our approach combines optimized face detection techniques with lightweight convolutional neural networks, complemented by several performance-enhancing optimizations. We demonstrate that our system achieves accuracy comparable to trained humans while maintaining processing speeds suitable for real-time applications.
