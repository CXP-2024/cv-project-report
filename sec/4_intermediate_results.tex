\section{Intermediate result}
\subsection{Implementation time}
If we follow the naive pipeline to deal with a video of length 2 minutes and 18 seconds of 15 frame per seconds, the implementation time on laptop CPU is 3 minutes, after the promotion of efficiency, we reduced the implementation time to 80 seconds on laptop CPU, which is a great improvement.
\subsection{Recognition accuracy}
As mentioned above, the accuracy for untrained human is about 40\% and the accuracy for trained human is about 60\%. This model achieved accuracy of 62\%, which is quite reasonable.
\subsection{Result demo}
This following is a picture, we can see that the model successfully found the faces in the picture and output the correct emotion

This following picture demonstrated the time we used for processing the video, which is about 1 minute and 20 seconds. For a 24 frame per second video, we can have real time detection
